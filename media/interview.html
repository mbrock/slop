    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:00">To find out, I spoke to expert science man and former D:Ream keyboardist, Dr. Brian Cox.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:08">How will the world end?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:10">Well, the sun will run out of fuel in about four billion years or so.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:16">And actually before that, it will begin to— to swell up, expand, and so we think the Earth will get incinerated.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:26">Do you think we might be able to do something about it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:28">Stop it being incinerated?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:29">Yeah, stop it being— or the— the sun burning the earth.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:32">Could we put it out with a big hose or something?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:34">It's an inevitable consequence of the laws of nature.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:39">You’re— are you pleased with that, are you?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:40">You’re happy with that, you can live with that?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:42">Well, there's nothing I can do.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:44">So this is— this is the actual Large Hadron Collider.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:48">So, am I right in thinking that this might prove the existence of chakras within the human body?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:53">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:54">You're not interested in chakras.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:00:57">No, in the same way I'm not interested in ghosts.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:00:59">But my Aunt Carol, she can sense chakras in someone's body.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:03">And she doesn’t need any machines.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:05">I mean also the Andromeda Galaxy is going to hit us.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:07">The Andromeda Galaxy?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:08">A whole galaxy is gonna hit us.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:09">Yeah.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:12">On about the same time scale actually.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:15">So as the sun runs out of fuel and expands and incinerates the Earth, a galaxy of 400 billion stars is gonna collide with us.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:24">You're much gloomier than I expected, because you're quite smiley.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:28">Well, yeah, well it's— it's quite a long time in the future.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:31">Um, this could explode at any minute, couldn't it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:33">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:34">How fast do the protons in this thing go?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:37">99.9999999% the speed of light.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:41">Your sense of smell is faster, isn't it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:43">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:44">Well, how come that when someone's frying bacon and you walk in the kitchen, you can smell it straight away before you've even seen it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:51">Have you ever tried putting bacon in here?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:01:56">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:01:56">Yeah, you should try it, you might make quantum bacon.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:00">Would that make it more interesting?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:01">A little bit.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:02">Why would it be more interesting?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:04">Because what it's trying to do—</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:05">I'm desperately— I'm trying to help you out here.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:08">I'm trying to like make it even slightly more interesting than it is.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:12">What what it did was it detected a thing called a Higgs particle, without the Higgs particle you me, and everything else that we know of in the universe, none of these things would exist.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:22">Can the Higgs boson rewind time?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:24">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:27">Can it tell when an earthquake's gonna go off?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:30">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:31">Can it make food spicier?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:33">It's just a particle.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:35">It's like saying, can an electron tell when an earthquake's gonna go off.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:40">Can it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:41">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:42">Oh.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:43">You said things can only get better.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:02:48">So, why can we trust anything you ever say now?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:50">Yeah, it's a gross misunderstanding of the laws of nature.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:02:54">It's it's one of the most misleading and scientifically inaccurate pop songs that's ever been written.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:01">Catchy though.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:03">Yeah, well but it's just inaccurate.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:04">Scientifically inaccurate.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:06">Things get worse.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:08">So, after the universe ends, there’ll be nothing.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:11">Depends what you mean by after the universe ends.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:13">When it's exploded.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:14">Well it's not gonna explode, it's gonna, we think, carry on expanding.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:19">Right.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:19">And then—</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:20">Forever.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:20">Well, that would be fine, wouldn't it, we need the space.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:23">What is quantum physics?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:25">Quantum physics is, so quantum mechanics is our best theory of how the world works.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:32">It describes everything that we've observed other than gravity.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:37">Do mirrors run on quantum physics?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:40">Run?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:41">Yeah.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:42">As in?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:03:44">Well, according to quantum physics, mirrors shouldn't work, they're a miracle.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:49">That's not correct.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:51">You get to the point, it carries on doing that, then galaxies get ripped apart.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:03:58">And then solar systems get ripped apart, and then even planets get ripped apart, and even atoms get ripped apart.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:07">So what?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:08">All the stars will die.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:10">Um, even all the black holes that are left, the final sort of end points of the most massive stars will evaporate away.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:18">Quantum theorionics proves there's infinite multiverses like in Marvel films, doesn't it?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:22">That's one interpretation of the theory.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:25">How many infinite multiverses are there?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:28">If there were an infinite number of multiverses, then the number of multiverses would be infinite.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:34">See, I think there's two.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:36">Ours and the one in mirrors.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:42">So can we, could we fall down a black hole?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:45">Yeah, you could fall into one.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:46">Is that the same?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:47">Because I heard that you could be— if, you know, this is one way that the world could end, is that we're all just sucked off through a hole.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:04:57">It's a— it's—</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:58">I mean, that must be terrible.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:04:59">Can you imagine what it would feel like to be sucked off through a hole?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:05:02">Yeah.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:05:03">Mirrors are windows into other universes, aren't they?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:05:06">No.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:05:07">My mate Paul says they run on quantum power, and that's why you can see into an alternative dimension in which everything's the same as our realm but backwards.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:05:15">What does Paul do?</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:05:16">Well, he worked in a tennis ball factory where he had to catch tennis balls, but he was fired from that and now he's unemployed.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S1" data-time="00:05:26">Sorry, I'm wasting your time.</span>
    <span data-speaker="S2" data-time="00:05:27">Yeah.</span>
